# Archive reason
CrossOver 24 beta1 works just fine with NosTale, so use it.

## What this really is?
This is custom CrossOver (wine-based solution) builder that enables support for old game called "NosTale".
It resolves this issue from bugzilla:

https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42999

And how it works? Because of some anticheat/antibug solution NosTale checks if 
it's calling own-code by verifying it's running under `0x70000000` memory range.
For some reason Wine places `user32.dll` in space reserved below that, causing bugs, 
and most importantly, making the entire game unplayable.

The solution was found by [Michael](https://github.com/morsisko) from NosApki team and Linux community.
I'm literally just putting it together to previously mentioned builder using simple custom patch (it's under `nostale.patch` file).

## Okey, but... I can't find CrossOver app file, instead I got wine executables!

That's the point. What you need to do is move `user32.dll` / `user32.so` files into CrossOver executable.
There are multiple catalogues in `CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/lib/wine` and you need to match each one using `wine` (not local) built files by GitHub actions.
Also you should replace executables in `CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin` too (using files from `bin` catalogue from custom `wine`).
Script that does it automatically should be provided soon.

## How this works?

1. See [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
2. See [`.github/workflows/build_monolithic.yml`](./.github/workflows/build_monolithic.yml)
3. See [`build_local.sh`](./build_local.sh)

## Is it working?

In principle yes, see the following image which is `notepad.exe` running inside wine on a macOS 10.15 machine:
![Notepad running in wine](doc/wine64_notepad.png)

## Inspiration

I learned about [Free and Open Source Software Code for CrossOver][foss-crossover] and found [this gist][crossover-gist].

## Where to download builds? How can I run them?

Builds are currently available as artifacts from github actions.
Simply go to [the Actions tab](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-wine-cloud-builder/actions), click the newest green run from the main branch, scroll down to the artifacts and select the version of your choice.
See however also [#25](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/issues/25).

After downloading and unpacking the tarball, e. g. to the `./wine-cx` folder, you need to remove the quarantine attribute using `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine wine-cx`.
Afterwards inside `./wine-cx/usr/local/bin` you will find the `wine32on64` and `wine64` binaries.

## Can I run the build locally?

It will only work if you're on macOS, but yes.
Clone the project, read the scripts first, then feel free to run [`build_local.command`](./build_local.command) üëç.
The script is a copy of the steps done in the github action in [`.github/workflows/build_monolithic.yml`](./.github/workflows/build_monolithic.yml).
It contains some variables to allow for customizations.

We try to keep [`build_local.sh`](./build_local.sh) synchronized with the action, but sometimes might miss a step.
In case of issues with the local build compare the script to the steps in [`.github/workflows/build_monolithic.yml`](./.github/workflows/build_monolithic.yml) and possibly open an issue.

Note, that this is an [MIT](LICENSE.md) repo. If you break something on your system doing so, it's your fault üòâ

## Can I contribute?

Definitely. Feel free to send PRs üöÄ
